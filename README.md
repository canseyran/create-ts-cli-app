# 🚀 Create TypeScript CLI App

Create TypeScript CLI App is a simple and efficient tool to set up a Node.js TypeScript project with minimal hassle. It comes pre-configured with essential tools and libraries, allowing you to focus on writing your code rather than setting up your environment.

## ✨ Features

- **📁 Single File Output**: Webpack bundles your project into a single JavaScript file with a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`). This allows for easy integration and sharing without needing to install npm packages.
- **🔷 TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves code quality.
- **🔍 ESLint**: Maintains code quality by identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript code.
- **💅 Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting.
- **🧪 Unit Testing**: Set up with Vitest to ensure your code is tested and reliable.
- **🛠️ CLI Tools**: Includes popular npm packages for creating CLI apps:
  - [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk): For styling command-line output.
  - [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander): For parsing command-line arguments.
  - [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer): For creating interactive command-line prompts.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To create a new project, run the following command:

```sh
npx @canseyran/create-ts-cli-app <project-directory>
```

Replace \`<project-directory>\` with your desired project folder name.

### 🛠️ Example usage

```sh
npx @canseyran/create-ts-cli-app random-trivia-app

cd random-trivia-app

npm run build

npm link # Symlinks the script to global/node environment

random-trivia-app fetch # Use symlinked cli tool globally
```

## 📜 Available Commands

Once your project is set up, you can use the following npm scripts:

- **Start**: Run the main TypeScript file.

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

- **Build**: Bundle your project into a single JavaScript file using Webpack.

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

- **Link**: Symlink the bundled executable into the global / node environment

  ```sh
  npm link
  ```

- **Development Mode**: Watch for changes and recompile automatically.

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Run Tests**: Execute your unit tests with Vitest.

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

- **Watch Tests**: Run your tests in watch mode.

  ```sh
  npm run test:watch
  ```

- **Format Code**: Format your code with Prettier.
  ```sh
  npm run format
  ```
